# NHLRosterModel

Thanks for the clarification! Predicting team points in an NHL regular season (i.e., standings points: 2 for a win, 1 for an OT/SO loss) is still a regression problem but at the team level. Here's how to get started:

🧠 Goal
Predict total team points (in the standings) for a given NHL season.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide
1. Define the Target
target = team_points → Total points a team earns in a regular season (max 164 under current 82-game rules: 82 wins x 2 pts)

2. Data Collection
You'll need historical season-level data for each team, such as:

🧩 Team-Level Stats
Goals For (GF), Goals Against (GA)

Shots For/Against

Powerplay % / Penalty Kill %

Save Percentage (SV%), Shooting Percentage (SH%)

Corsi/Fenwick (possession metrics)

Faceoff %, Zone starts

PDO (SV% + SH%)

🧍‍♂️ Player-Level Aggregates (optional)
Avg player age

Total team salary

Star power: number of 60+ point players, average WAR (from Evolving Hockey or HockeyViz)

Injuries (games lost by top players)

📋 Roster Composition
Skater depth (forwards vs defensemen ratio)

Goalie performance (SV%, GSAx, GSAA)

🆚 Strength of Schedule / Division
Conference/Division

Average opponent strength (based on previous year or preseason projections)

🕐 Timeframe
Collect at least 5–10 seasons of data (32 teams × ~10 years = 300+ rows)

3. Feature Engineering
Rolling averages (3-year average team stats)

Offseason changes: number of new players, coaching changes, goalie change

Use “delta” features: e.g., change in GF from last season

Encode categorical variables: team, division, coach

4. Modeling
Use regression models like:

Linear Regression (baseline)

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost or LightGBM)

Neural Network Regressor (if you have deep feature engineering)

Train on past seasons (e.g., 2010–2019), test on recent seasons (e.g., 2020–2024).

5. Evaluation
Use metrics like:

RMSE / MAE (how close your predictions are)

R² score

Analyze residuals: are some teams consistently under/overpredicted?

6. Optional Advanced Layers
If you want to be more accurate:

Build a player-level model to simulate individual contributions → aggregate to team level.

Use Elo ratings or pre-season Vegas odds as inputs.

Include transaction data (e.g., added player WAR)
